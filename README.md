I'm planning on rewriting [Flicker](https://github.com/fractioneater/flicker) in C++, but first, I need to learn C++.

That means this repo may be full of bad code. Use at your own risk.<br>
_But you're actually allowed to use it! Unlike many others who aren't aware how things work, I gave it a license._
